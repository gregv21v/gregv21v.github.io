    <h1>Home</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my github website!!</p>

    <p>
      I have many github projects on my Github website. Some of them are more developed then others. To help
      you navigate my github better, I have created this website.
      I will try my best to keep this up to date because it changes all the time.
