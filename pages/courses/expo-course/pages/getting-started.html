        <p>Install expo-cli on your local machine with the following command:</p>

        <code>npm install --global expo-cli</code>

        <p>
          Then once you have the expo cli installed you can use it to create a
          new expo project.
        </p>

        <code>expo init tic-tac-toe-app</code>

        <p>
            Expo will give you a fill options after you enter the init command.
        </p>

          ----- Managed workflow -----
          > blank                 a minimal app as clean as an empty canvas
          blank (TypeScript)    same as blank but with TypeScript configuration
          tabs (TypeScript)     several example screens and tabs using react-navigation and TypeScript
          ----- Bare workflow -----
          minimal               bare and minimal, just the essentials to get you started
          minimal (TypeScript)  same as minimal but with TypeScript configuration
        </pre>


        <p>
          We can either choose from Managed workflow, or Bare workflow. Bare workflow is for if you
          want specific functionality that you couldn't otherwise get with the managed workflow. We
          are going to use managed workflow, because it will do most of the heavy lifting for us.
          We going to create a blank project with nothing in it. If you want you
          can explore the other types of basic projects on your own.
        </p>

        <p>
          Give expo some time to create the initial setup of the app, then you can then open
          your favorite text editor and explore the expo starter code. I use Atom. If you have atom installed you can type the following two commands to open your project in atom.
        </p>

        <pre>
          cd tic-tac-toe-app
          atom .
