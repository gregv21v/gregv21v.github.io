        <h2>What is expo?</h2>
        <p>
          Expo is a multi-platform SDK. You can write code with Expo
          then have it built on Web, Android, and IOS platforms. It's built off of React
          Native, so it uses a lot of react native's code.
        </p>

        <h2>Why use expo?</h2>
        <p>
          Expo is good if you want to develop a cross platform app for both Android and IOS
          but are working on a windows computer. You can compile your Expo code remotely with Expo
          builds and run it through the Expo simulator app on IOS or Android.
