      <h2>Github Projects</h2>


      <p>
        I have many github projects on my Github website. Some of them are more developed then others. To help
        you navigate my github better, here is a list of the most important repos that I pay the most attention to.
        I will try my best to keep this up to date because it changes all the time.
      </p>

      <h3>Chemistry Lab</h3>
      <p>
        The first repo I want to draw attention to is Chemistry Lab. It's a game I'm working on about mixing various
        chemicals together. The game is inspired by the Minecraft Mod - Build Craft, and my love of chemistry. I worked
        on this towards the end of my college years, and again the time of writing this.
      </p>

      <p>Important Links:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I have a blog completely devoted to the development of chemistry lab
          <a href="https://mygamedevelopmentexperience.blogspot.com/">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can play the game in its current state <a href="http://gregv21v.github.io/Chem-Lab/">here</a>.

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Spending Tracker</h3>
      <p>
        The next repo I want to draw attention to is Spending Tracker. Its an app made with the Expo SDK
        to track your receipts. I mention it because it's what I'm currently working on. In it's current
        state you can add receipts, and receipt items then add them to the local storage of the app.

      <h3>Here is a example animation with JavaScript just for fun:</h3>
      <div id="example1">
        <svg>

        </svg>
      </div>

      <script>
        var mainSvg = d3.select("svg")
          .attr("width", 500)
          .attr("height", 100)

        var cir = mainSvg
          .append('circle')
            .attr("cx", 50)
            .attr("cy", 50)
            .attr("r", 20)
            .style("fill", "red")

        cir.transition()
          .attr("cx", 500 - 25)
          .delay(500)
      </script>
